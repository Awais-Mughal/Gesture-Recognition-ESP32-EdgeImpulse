# IOT-Project-2
# Machine Learning Based Wirless Home Automation

This project demonstrates a wireless communication system using two Xiao BLE ESP32-C3 boards. The transmitter board is equipped with an MPU6050 accelerometer, while the receiver board features a 0.96" OLED display. The system is designed to detect movements using the MPU6050 and display corresponding signals on the OLED display and turn on and off the lights.

## Hardware Components

- **Transmitter Board:**
  - Xiao BLE ESP32-C3
  - MPU6050 Accelerometer

- **Receiver Board:**
  - Xiao BLE ESP32-C3
  - 0.96" OLED Display

## Dependencies

- [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/): Used for training the MPU6050 data.
